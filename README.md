Welcome to Stream Chate Overlay. This app allows you to
view Stream Chat Overlays from various services in game!

Launch a game, and the In-Game window will pop-up automatically!

How does it work?

1. When you load into a game for the first time the app will appear
with the settings button (Blue button in the upper-left) already expanded.
Just past your overlay url into the box and click Save

2. You can use the maximize button (Yellow button in the upper-left)
To show/hide the size and opacity sliders

3. You can use ALT+CTRL+T (by default) to show/hide the Header
